(##) About this template

* Structure your report using numbers and titles following those of the assignment.

* Replace reference images with your own screenshots or renders when applicable.

* Include descriptions of any encountered problems and the time you spent on each task.

(##) A1T1 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a1.task1.cpp` file and 
checking that transformations can be correctly applied in the GUI.

(##) A1T2 CHECKPOINT

(##) A1T3 CHECKPOINT

<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/A1T3.png" alt="Rasterize flat cubes">
</div>


(##) A1T4 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. However, please answer the following questions about `media/js3d/A1T4-blend-depth.js3d1`:
* What combination of blend and depth styles would enable us to see three colors?
    * Red: Blend: Replace, Depth: Less 
    * Green: Blend: Replace, Depth: Less
    * Blue: Blend: Replace, Depth: Less
* What combination of blend and depth styles would enable us to see five colors?
    * Red: Blend: Add, Depth: Less
    * Green: Blend: Add, Depth: Less
    * Blue: Blend: Add, Depth: Less

Do note that there are multiple correct answers to the above two questions - as long as you provide a valid one, you will receive credit.

Your completion will be graded based on the on the above answers, the reference `test.a1.task4.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing with different blend and depth modes will look decent.

(##) A1T5 FINAL

(##) A1T6 FINAL

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a1.task6.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing the samplers scene will look decent.

(##) A1T7 FINAL

<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/Sample_pattern.png" alt="Sample pattern">
</div>

Explanation of what your SamplePattern does and scenarios it would do well and poorly in:

My Sample Pattern has 4 samples in 1 pixel, and their reletive position to the pixel are: 
(5/8,1/8), (1/8,3/8), (7/8,5/8), (3/8,7/8). This sample pattern can do well when the pixel is half covered by diagonal lines, 
because it will present 50% coverage in that case. However, this sample pattern only has 4 different super samples, so it's ability of anti-aliasing is still not enough for most random cases.


(##) RASTERIZED IMAGE FINAL

<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/render.png" alt="Render Image">
</div>
These are 3 hearts in different transformations and texture. I imported the obj file of heart model and transform them into right position. I changed the color of the texture (tried image but it doesn't work well may be because of unmapped UV?) for different hearts. Finally I created a camera and use blend over, depth less for blending and depth test mode to render the image.
